## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### CloudEvents Integration
```python
# Emit decision CloudEvent
from src.orca.core.ce import emit_decision_event
ce = emit_decision_event(decision_data, "txn_1234567890abcdef")

# Emit explanation CloudEvent
from src.orca.core.ce import emit_explanation_event
ce = emit_explanation_event(explanation_data, "txn_1234567890abcdef")
```

### CLI Usage
```bash
# Emit CloudEvents with CLI
export ORCA_CE_SUBSCRIBER_URL="http://localhost:8080/events"
python -m orca_core.cli decide '{"cart_total": 100.0}' --emit-ce
```

### Weave Integration
```bash
# Start Weave subscriber
cd weave && python subscriber.py

# Check receipt
curl http://localhost:8080/receipts/txn_1234567890abcdef
```
