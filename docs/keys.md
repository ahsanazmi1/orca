# Keys and Security Reference

## Overview

This document describes key management and security practices for the Open Checkout Network (OCN).

## Key Types

### Encryption Keys
- **AES-256**: Symmetric encryption for data at rest
- **RSA-2048**: Asymmetric encryption for key exchange
- **ECDSA-P256**: Elliptic curve cryptography

### Signing Keys
- **Ed25519**: High-performance elliptic curve signatures
- **RSA-PSS**: Probabilistic signature scheme
- **ECDSA**: Elliptic curve digital signature algorithm

### API Keys
- **Service Keys**: Inter-service communication
- **Client Keys**: Client application authentication
- **Admin Keys**: Administrative operations

## Key Management

### Generation
- Use cryptographically secure random number generators
- Minimum 256-bit entropy for symmetric keys
- Validate key strength before use

### Storage
- Hardware security modules (HSM) for production
- Encrypt keys at rest with master keys
- Implement key versioning and rotation

### Rotation
- Regular rotation schedule (90 days recommended)
- Graceful transition with overlapping keys
- Automated rotation for non-critical keys

## Security Practices

### Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for all sensitive data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications

### Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication for admin access
- Service-to-service authentication with certificates
- Principle of least privilege

### Audit and Monitoring
- Log all key operations
- Monitor for suspicious activities
- Implement alerting for security events

## Compliance

### PCI DSS
- Secure key management
- Regular security assessments
- Access control requirements

### GDPR
- Data encryption requirements
- Right to erasure (key deletion)
- Privacy impact assessments

## Emergency Procedures

### Key Compromise
1. Revoke compromised key immediately
2. Generate new replacement key
3. Update all systems
4. Investigate scope
5. Notify stakeholders

### Key Loss
1. Verify key loss
2. Check backup availability
3. Generate new key if needed
4. Update affected systems

## Best Practices

1. Use strong keys (minimum 256-bit entropy)
2. Rotate regularly (90-day cycle)
3. Store securely (use HSMs)
4. Monitor usage (log all operations)
5. Plan for incidents (emergency procedures)
6. Stay compliant (regulatory standards)
7. Document everything (comprehensive records)
8. Test procedures (regular testing)
