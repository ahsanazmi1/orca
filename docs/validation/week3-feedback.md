## Reviewer 1: Maria Rodriguez (E-commerce Manager)
**Role**: E-commerce Operations Manager at mid-size online retailer
**Date**: 2025-09-11
**Scenario Tested**: Card velocity decline, ACH limit exceeded, multiple reasons

### Review Responses

**Question 1 - Clarity:** ✅ Excellent
The explanations are very clear and easy to understand. No technical jargon - my customer service team could easily explain these to customers. The language is straightforward and professional.

**Question 2 - Accuracy:** ✅ Excellent
Perfect match between the JSON reasons and the human explanations. When I saw "velocity_flag" in the reasons, the explanation said "too many recent attempts" which is exactly right.

**Question 3 - Trust:** ⚠️ Needs Improvement
The explanations are good but could be more specific. For example, "Declined: Amount exceeds ACH limit of $2,000" is great, but it would be even better to say "Please try an amount under $2,000 or use a different payment method."

**Question 4 - Support:** ✅ Excellent
This would definitely reduce our support time. Customers will understand why their transaction was declined without needing to call us. The explanations are self-explanatory.

**Question 5 - Jargon:** ✅ Excellent
No confusing terms. Everything is in plain English that customers can understand.

**Question 6 - Improvements:** ⚠️ Needs Improvement
Would love to see:
- Specific next steps for each scenario
- Timeframes (e.g., "wait 2 hours before trying again")
- Alternative payment suggestions

### Overall Rating: ✅ Excellent

**Key Strengths:**
- Crystal clear language
- Perfect accuracy with JSON reasons
- Professional tone
- Would reduce support calls significantly

**Key Issues:**
- Missing actionable next steps
- Could be more prescriptive about alternatives
