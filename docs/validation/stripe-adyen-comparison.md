# Stripe/Adyen Comparison: Transparency Analysis

## Overview
This document compares Orca's transparent decision-making process against traditional payment processors (Stripe and Adyen) using the same transaction scenario.

## Test Transaction
- **Cart Total**: $1,250.00 USD
- **Customer**: GOLD tier, 450-day-old account
- **Location**: IP from Canada, billing in US
- **Velocity**: 3.5 transactions in 24h
- **Payment**: Visa ending in 1234

## Decision Outputs Comparison

### Orca Decision Engine (Full Transparency)
```json
{
  "decision": "REVIEW",
  "reasons": [
    "HIGH_TICKET: Cart total $1250.00 exceeds $500.00 threshold",
    "VELOCITY_FLAG: 24h velocity 3.5 exceeds 3.0 threshold",
    "LOCATION_MISMATCH: IP country 'CA' differs from billing country 'US'",
    "LOYALTY_BOOST: Customer has GOLD loyalty tier"
  ],
  "actions": [
    "ROUTE_TO_REVIEW",
    "ROUTE_TO_REVIEW",
    "ROUTE_TO_REVIEW",
    "LOYALTY_BOOST"
  ],
  "meta": {
    "risk_score": 0.15,
    "rules_evaluated": ["HIGH_TICKET", "VELOCITY", "LOCATION_MISMATCH", "LOYALTY_BOOST"]
  }
}
```

### Stripe Response (Black Box)
```json
{
  "status": "requires_action",
  "outcome": {
    "reason": "manual_review_required",
    "risk_level": "elevated",
    "risk_score": 45,
    "seller_message": "This payment requires additional verification."
  }
}
```

### Adyen Response (Partial Transparency)
```json
{
  "resultCode": "Pending",
  "fraudResult": {
    "accountScore": 45,
    "results": [
      {"accountScore": 45, "name": "ShopPERatio"},
      {"accountScore": 67, "name": "DeviceFingerprint"},
      {"accountScore": 23, "name": "GeoLocation"},
      {"accountScore": 78, "name": "VelocityCheck"}
    ]
  },
  "riskData": {
    "riskScore": 45,
    "riskLevel": "HIGH",
    "reason": "Multiple risk factors detected"
  }
}
```

## Transparency Analysis

| Aspect | Orca | Stripe | Adyen |
|--------|------|--------|-------|
| **Rule Visibility** | ✅ Full | ❌ None | ⚠️ Partial |
| **Threshold Disclosure** | ✅ Exact | ❌ Hidden | ❌ Hidden |
| **Actionable Insights** | ✅ Specific | ❌ Generic | ❌ Limited |
| **Human Readable** | ✅ Clear | ❌ Vague | ⚠️ Mixed |
| **Customizable** | ✅ Full Control | ❌ No Control | ❌ No Control |

## Key Differences

### Orca Advantages
1. **Explicit Rule Explanations**: Each rule clearly states why it triggered
2. **Exact Thresholds**: $500 cart limit, 3.0 velocity threshold
3. **Actionable Insights**: Specific actions for each rule violation
4. **Business-Friendly**: Human-readable explanations
5. **Full Audit Trail**: Complete visibility into decision process
6. **Customizable**: Rules and thresholds can be modified

### Payment Processor Limitations
1. **Black Box Algorithms**: Proprietary risk models
2. **Vague Explanations**: Generic error messages
3. **No Rule Details**: Limited visibility into decision factors
4. **No Thresholds**: Hidden decision criteria
5. **Limited Actionability**: Generic seller messages
6. **Vendor Lock-in**: Dependent on processor's algorithms

## Business Impact

### Orca Benefits
- **Merchant Control**: Understand and optimize risk rules
- **False Positive Reduction**: Clear path to tune rules
- **Compliance**: Full audit trail for regulatory requirements
- **Customer Experience**: Explain decisions to customers
- **Business Intelligence**: Learn from decision patterns

### Payment Processor Drawbacks
- **Black Box Decisions**: Must trust opaque algorithms
- **No Optimization**: Cannot improve false positive rates
- **Customer Confusion**: Cannot explain declines
- **Limited Insights**: No learning from decision patterns
- **Vendor Dependency**: No control over decision logic

## Conclusion

Orca provides complete transparency in decision-making, enabling merchants to understand, debug, and optimize their risk management strategies. In contrast, Stripe and Adyen offer limited transparency, forcing merchants to trust proprietary black-box algorithms without the ability to understand or improve decision outcomes.

This transparency gap represents a significant competitive advantage for Orca in the risk management space.
