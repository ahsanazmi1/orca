# Stripe Radar vs Orca Core: Phase 2 Comparison

## Executive Summary

This document compares Stripe Radar's opaque decision-making approach with Orca Core's transparent, explainable AI/LLM integration. The comparison demonstrates how Orca's open architecture provides superior visibility, debugging capabilities, and merchant trust compared to traditional "black box" payment processing solutions.

## Key Differentiators

| Aspect | Stripe Radar | Orca Core |
|--------|--------------|-----------|
| **Transparency** | ❌ Opaque decisions | ✅ Full decision visibility |
| **Explanations** | ❌ Generic error messages | ✅ Detailed human-readable explanations |
| **Risk Scoring** | ❌ Hidden ML models | ✅ Transparent risk scores with feature attribution |
| **Debugging** | ❌ Limited debugging tools | ✅ Comprehensive debug UI with toggles |
| **Customization** | ❌ Limited rule configuration | ✅ Full rule system with ML integration |
| **Audit Trail** | ❌ Basic logging | ✅ Complete decision audit trail |

## Decision Transparency Comparison

### Stripe Radar Response (Typical)

```json
{
  "id": "pi_1234567890",
  "object": "payment_intent",
  "status": "requires_payment_method",
  "last_payment_error": {
    "code": "card_declined",
    "decline_code": "generic_decline",
    "message": "Your card was declined."
  }
}
```

**Issues with Stripe's approach:**
- No explanation of why the card was declined
- Generic error message provides no actionable information
- No visibility into risk factors or decision logic
- Merchant cannot understand or improve their approval rates

### Orca Core Response (Phase 2)

```json
{
  "status": "DECLINE",
  "decision": "DECLINE",
  "reasons": [
    "HIGH_RISK: ML risk score 0.850 exceeds 0.800 threshold",
    "ml_score_high",
    "velocity_flag: 8 transactions in 24h exceeds 5 threshold"
  ],
  "actions": ["BLOCK"],
  "meta": {
    "risk_score": 0.850,
    "model_version": "stub-0.1",
    "features_used": ["cart_total", "item_count", "velocity_24h", "location_mismatch"],
    "rules_evaluated": ["VELOCITY_CHECK", "HIGH_RISK"],
    "timestamp": "2025-01-15T10:30:45.123456",
    "transaction_id": "txn_a82c4dfcfbe945e4"
  },
  "explanation_human": "Declined: High ML risk score detected. Unusual transaction pattern detected.",
  "signals_triggered": ["VELOCITY_CHECK", "HIGH_RISK"]
}
```

**Benefits of Orca's approach:**
- Clear explanation of decline reasons
- Transparent risk score with model version
- Feature attribution shows which factors influenced the decision
- Human-readable explanation for merchants
- Complete audit trail for compliance

## ML Integration Comparison

### Stripe Radar ML

- **Model**: Proprietary, undisclosed
- **Features**: Unknown, not disclosed to merchants
- **Thresholds**: Hidden, cannot be customized
- **Updates**: Automatic, no visibility into changes
- **Debugging**: Limited to basic error codes

### Orca Core ML (Phase 2)

- **Model**: Transparent stub model with deterministic scoring
- **Features**: Clearly documented and visible
- **Thresholds**: Configurable and transparent
- **Updates**: Version-controlled with clear change tracking
- **Debugging**: Full feature attribution and decision tree visibility
