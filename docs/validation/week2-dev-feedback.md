## Mock Developer Feedback (Simulated)

### Reviewer 1: Alex Chen (Backend Developer)
**Role**: Payment Processing Engineer
**Date**: 2025-09-11

#### Schema & Contract
- **rail field**: ✅ - Clear enum with Card/ACH, easy to understand and implement
- **channel field**: ✅ - Online/POS distinction is practical and matches real-world usage
- **reasons[] array**: ✅ - Machine-readable codes are perfect for automated handling
- **actions[] array**: ✅ - Specific actions like "step_up_auth" and "fallback_card" are actionable

#### Implementation Experience
- **CLI usability**: ✅ - `--rail` and `--channel` flags work well, stdin support is great
- **Error handling**: ✅ - Clear validation errors, graceful failures for edge cases
- **Documentation quality**: ✅ - Contract.md is comprehensive with examples
- **Integration difficulty**: ✅ - JSON I/O is straightforward, Pydantic models help

#### Specific Feedback
