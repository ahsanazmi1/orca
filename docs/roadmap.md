# Orca Roadmap

## Phase 1 — Foundations (Weeks 1–4)

### Positioning (CMO):
- **Anchor story:** "Checkout hasn't changed in 20 years. B2B payments are even worse."
- **Narrative:** transparency + explainability vs. black-box fraud/routing.
- **ICPs:** mid-market SaaS, marketplaces, exporters (international B2B).

### Execution (GTM):
- **LinkedIn #1:** Why checkout hasn't changed in 20 years. ✅
- **LinkedIn #2:** Introducing Orca — the first open checkout agent. ✅
- **Community:** repo public, README + roadmap visible.

### Build (Dev):
- **Rules engine skeleton**
- **JSON decision contract (draft)**
- **CLI + Streamlit stubs**

### Exit criteria (Week 4):
- **Public repo with docs**
- **Two posts live**
- **At least 5 ICP conversations**

## Phase 2 — AI/Explainability (Weeks 4–8)

- **Plain-English "Why" explanations (LLM-ready interface)**
- **Debug UI: toggle Rules-only vs Rules+AI**
- **Prep Azure scaffolding (AKS, ACR, Key Vault, GitHub Actions OIDC)**

## Phase 3 — Routing & Rails (Weeks 8–12)
