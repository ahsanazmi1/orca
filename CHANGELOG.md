## [0.1.0] - 2024-01-21

### ðŸŽ¯ Phase 1 Complete: Rules Engine + CloudEvents Integration

This is the first major release of Orca, establishing the foundation for open, transparent, merchant-controlled checkout with explainability built in.

#### Highlights
- **Deterministic Rules Engine**: Complete rules engine with APPROVE/DECLINE/REVIEW outcomes
- **AP2 Decision Contract v1**: Standardized decision payload format with full traceability
- **CloudEvents v1 Integration**: Event-driven architecture foundation for decision processing
- **Weave Blockchain Integration**: Receipt storage for immutable audit trails
- **ocn-common Schema Validation**: Cross-stack contract validation and compliance

#### Contracts
- **AP2 version=1**: Standardized decision payload format with structured mandates
- **CloudEvents v1**: Event-driven architecture with ocn.orca.decision.v1 and ocn.orca.explanation.v1
- **ocn-common Schemas**: JSON Schema validation for all contracts and events
- **Weave Audit Events**: ocn.weave.audit.v1 for blockchain receipt tracking

#### Quality
- **Comprehensive Test Suite**: 90%+ test coverage with deterministic outcomes
- **Schema Validation**: All contracts validated against ocn-common schemas
- **Security-First CI/CD**: Automated security scanning and contract validation
- **Deterministic ML**: Fixed random seeds for reproducible results

#### Security
- **No PCI/PII Persistence**: Only receipt hashes stored in blockchain
- **Comprehensive Scanning**: pip-audit, trivy, bandit, and semgrep integration
- **Contract Validation**: Prevents malformed data and ensures compliance
- **Audit Trails**: Complete traceability from decision to blockchain receipt
